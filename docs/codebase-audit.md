# Codebase audit

## Overview

This audit combined automated checks (Jest, ESLint, Prettier) with targeted review of high-risk modules such as caching utilities and the advanced tool registry. The goal was to surface latent defects, noisy logging, and maintainability risks that could destabilise agent orchestration.

## Key findings

### Cache and rate limiting utilities

- `simpleCache` now avoids capturing unused rejection arguments while still retrying failed lookups so each caller gets a fresh error instance or resolved value without polluting the shared cache entry.【F:src/services/utils/cacheAndRate.js†L15-L60】
- TTL inputs are validated before caching, preventing `NaN`, `Infinity`, or negative windows from freezing entries in the map; Jest coverage asserts both the guardrails and the unchanged happy-path semantics in the cache-and-rate Jest suite.【F:src/services/utils/cacheAndRate.js†L20-L58】【390c08†L18-L124】
- `rateLimiter` guards against invalid delays and automatically resets the provider queue after an error, which prevents deadlocks but depends on consumers handling rejected promises to avoid rapid-fire retries.【F:src/services/utils/cacheAndRate.js†L63-L113】

### File system tool diagnostics

- The file system tool correctly sanitises paths via `resolveSafePath` and rejects directory traversal, emitting structured telemetry alongside a logged error; the Jest suite intentionally exercises this failure path, which is why repeated console noise appears in test output.【F:src/architecture/toolSystem.js†L291-L416】

### Plugin activation logs

- LLM plugin hooks broadcast activation messages (`Sparse attention plugin initialized`, `Switching to Q8_0 quantization`), confirming that instrumentation remains wired through the plugin manager and service logger; retain these logs for observability but consider demoting to debug in production builds if they become verbose.【F:src/architecture/pluginSetup.js†L1-L30】【F:src/architecture/pluginManager.js†L1-L60】【F:src/services/llmService.js†L296-L327】

### Memory retrieval and context planning

- `MemoryManager` threads `VectorIndexer`, `Retriever`, and `HistoryService` together so interactions are indexed, retrieved, and persisted with the same embedding service that powers runtime recall; detaching any one service would orphan conversation history or sparse attention fallbacks.【F:src/core/memory/MemoryManager.js†L1-L35】
- `ContextEngineer` raises relevance thresholds, prunes via hierarchical sparse attention, and ranks by device-aware quality scoring, ensuring memory recall respects token budgets on low-memory devices while still prioritising fresh or knowledge-base content.【F:src/services/contextEngineer.js†L16-L176】

### Prompt routing and tool execution

- `PromptBuilder` normalises tool metadata before injecting it into the system prompt so downstream parsing keeps deterministic ordering and excludes malformed entries.【F:src/core/prompt/PromptBuilder.js†L1-L71】
- `ToolHandler` validates required parameters, surfaces parser errors for malformed tool calls, and routes telemetry to the workflow tracer/logger so missing arguments or execution failures are observable without halting orchestration.【F:src/core/tools/ToolHandler.js†L1-L198】

## Recommendations

- Maintain the updated caching behaviour to keep ESLint passing and ensure `npm run lint` remains part of pre-commit checks, because the repo enforces strict unused-parameter rules.【F:src/services/utils/cacheAndRate.js†L15-L60】
- Enforce numeric TTL and delay inputs in downstream integrations; the new guards fail fast and tests capture the contract so caller bugs do not silently pin stale cache entries or saturate provider queues.【F:src/services/utils/cacheAndRate.js†L20-L113】【390c08†L51-L178】
- When investigating file-system issues, reference the structured error payload returned by the tool rather than the raw console output to avoid mistaking defensive logging for regressions.【F:src/architecture/toolSystem.js†L291-L416】
- If runtime logging becomes noisy, add log-level gating around plugin lifecycle events so release builds can mute informational output without sacrificing diagnostics during development.【F:src/architecture/pluginManager.js†L1-L60】【F:src/services/llmService.js†L296-L327】

## Test status

- Jest: 19 suites, 71 tests passing.【72ad4b†L20-L24】
- ESLint: No issues after cache utility update.【c1fc40†L1-L5】
- Prettier: Formatting verified for the entire project.【b7386a†L1-L6】
