# Citations

Guidelines for citing resources used in this project.

## Images and diagrams

When referencing an image or diagram, include the relative file path to the asset and provide a descriptive caption or figure number when available. Example:

```
![System architecture](docs/images/system-architecture.png)
```

This ensures that visual resources can be accurately traced to their source within the repository.
